This project uses the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This is a classification problem. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.

The target variable is the flower species.
